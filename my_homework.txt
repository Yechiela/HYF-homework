Hello Kitty,

Cat is the most funny animal in the world, they love being bossy and seems to be  so ignorant but they are so sweet and super friendly when they want to have the cat's treats.

They never play football when we are all awake, they will play football together immediately when the light is turned off and humans all go to bed.

They have certain sound to communicate like “Ngaew Ngae” means “I want the cat's treat”.

They hug us when we go out in the winter time but when we get home where heater is on, they just leave us and be wherever they want to be but not in our arms :D

Hello kitty!!!! It is me!!!
